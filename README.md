# Quantum-Inspired NAS with Attention-Based Search Spaces in Medical Applications

This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper "Quantum-Inspired NAS with Attention-Based Search Spaces in Medical Applications". It implements an enhanced Quantum-Inspired Neural Architecture Search (Q-NAS) approach incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) to achieve efficient, high-performing CNN models for medical image classification tasks using the MedMNIST datasets.
